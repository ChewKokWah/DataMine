# RACE: Large-scale ReAding Comprehension Dataset From Examinations


Dataset description
--------

Collected from the English exams for middle and high school Chinese students
in the age range between 12 to 18, RACE consists of near 28,000 passages and
near 100,000 questions generated by human experts (English instructors), and
covers a variety of topics which are carefully designed for evaluating the
studentsâ€™ ability in understanding and reasoning.

In particular, the proportion of questions that requires reasoning is much
larger in RACE than that in other benchmark datasets for reading
comprehension, and there is a significant gap between the performance of the
state-of-the-art models (43%) and the ceiling human performance (95%).
